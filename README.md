# metro-stax-ex

This project contains a few extensions to complement JSR-173 StAX API in the following areas:

* Enable parser instance reuse (which is important in the high-performance environment like JAXB and JAX-WS)
* Improve the support for reading from non-text XML infoset, such as FastInfoset.
* Improve the namespace support.

:warning: This project is now part of the EE4J initiative. This repository
has been archived as all activities are now happening in the 
[corresponding Eclipse repository](https://github.com/eclipse-ee4j/jaxb-stax-ex).
